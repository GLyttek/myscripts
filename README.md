Building a Test Matrix:
To test the output of your local models, you can create a matrix that evaluates several criteria:

Accuracy: Does the content correctly describe the technical processes and concepts?
Clarity: Is the information presented in an understandable and logical manner?
Completeness: Does the output cover all aspects outlined in the input instructions?
Language Proficiency: How well does the model handle the German language in terms of grammar, syntax, and vocabulary?
Relevance: Is the content relevant to the topics of cybersecurity and technical writing?
Formatting: Does the model correctly use markdown or other formatting as instructed?
You can rate these criteria on a scale (e.g., 1-5) for each section generated by the model and then calculate an overall score for each document. This will help you assess the model's performance in these specific areas.
